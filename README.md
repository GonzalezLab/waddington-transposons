Scripts for analyzing TE insertions the paper "A mechanistic basis for genetic assimilation in natural fly populations".

## Folders
- **0. Data processing**:  retrieving fastq files for each sample and run `fastp`
- **2. PoPoolationTE2**: scripts for preparing inputs, running `PoPoolationTE2` and process results
- **3. TEMP2**: scripts for preparing inputs, running `TEMP2` and process results
- **4. Common insertions**: find common TE insertions between `PoPoolationTE2` and `TEMP2` using `bedtools`
- **5. Post analysis**: obtaining `TEMP2` frequency for *de novo* and segregating TE insertions, perform Fisher's exact test in `R`
